## Topics We Cover

We currently offer workshops on using [git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"},
[Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"}, and [Julia](https://julialang.org/){:target="_blank"}.

If you're interested in other topics, [please contact us](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=Q70920tMREWfigVT-fXyXhzneNUovu5PtGNjpXtVg8NUMTNMNDdKQUhFNFpMTjBEVEtSVjZLOUcwNC4u&origin=lprLink&route=shorturl){:target="_blank"}.

## What We Offer

We provide both in-person and virtual workshops.

* [In-Person]({{ site.github_url }}/in-person)
* [Virtual]({{ site.github_url }}/virtual)

The goal of these workshops is to teach our workforce how to use computers more
effectively to make their research easier. We avoid a lot of the theory that is
taught in introductory computer science classes in favor of covering more of the
practical side of programming and data analysis that is necessary for conducting research. 

All of our workshops actively integrate with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/){:target="_blank"}.

## Why The Carpentries?

Carpentry-style workshops rely on live coding together with the instructor. This helps us
ensure that everyone in the workshop is able to follow along with, and get the most out of,
the material.

## Who We Are

The ORNL Carpentries team is a collaborative group of data and software experts from across
the lab, including the Research Library, CCSD, ITSD, and ESTD. Together, we provide hands-on
training to help researchers build foundational software skills for their work.
